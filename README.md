# riotAPI

 This is a project where I used an riot API(League of Legends) to get the data from it. The data is stored into a table in a database(Microsoft SQL Server is what I used).
You introduce 2 players and it displays the common games they have played together, the champion they played each of them including the other teammates.
It also displays the type of team (blue or red) and you can query the data from the SSMS to get data, on the IDE it displays the games but it loads them on database too.
